Farmers, traders, and politicians need to be able to predict agricultural commodity prices in order to plan ahead and make informed decisions. But it's challenging to generate precise forecasts because of things like seasonality, yield variability, perishability, and price volatility. This study focuses on assessing the effectiveness of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques in forecasting the extremely volatile prices of agricultural products in India. In order to address these challenges, researchers have investigated various statistical and artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods for price prediction.
